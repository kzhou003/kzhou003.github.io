The theory and modeling work in this project supports the experimental work of Prof. Jeanie Lauâ€™s group. I am tasked with providing electronic band structures, Landau level energies, and resistivity for tetralayer graphene using the electronic structure calculated from a tight-binding model as input into the Boltzmann transport equation within a relaxation time approximation.<br />
