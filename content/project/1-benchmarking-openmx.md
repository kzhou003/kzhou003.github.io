OpenMX is an open-source software package for nano-scale material simulations based on density functional theories (DFT), norm-conserving pseudopotentials, and pseudo- atomic localized basis functions. Systems consisting of 1000 atoms can be treated using the conventional diagonalization method. Non-quilibrium Green functions (NEGF) is also implemented into the package. To help calculate electron transport for several systems with large computing requirements, I benchmarked the performance of this software.<br />
