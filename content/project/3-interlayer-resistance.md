The electron and hole interlayer resistivities of misoriented bilayer MoS2 were deter- mined as a function of the misorientation angle. The approach employed electronic structure calculations using the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP) combined with NEGF calculations of the interlayer resistivity. I found that the electron and hole resistivities differed by several orders of magnitude depending on the rotation angle, and how this property could be exploited in the design of a high-frequency bipolar junction transistor or heterostructure bipolar transistor. This work has been published in Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics.<br />
