# Biography

I am a PhD candidate working on electronic structure and transport in two-dimensional materials including transition metal dichalcogenides, graphene, and boron nitride. The methods I employ include density functional theory as implemented in VASP and OpenMX, empirical tight-binding models, and non-equilibrium Green functions (NEGF). I am supervised by Prof. Roger K. Lake in the LAboratory for Terascale and Terahertz Electronics (LATTE).
